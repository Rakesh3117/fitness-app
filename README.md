# Fitness App - Drag and Drop Chart Management

## Overview
The **Fitness App** leverages the `react-beautiful-dnd` library to offer an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for workout chart management. This application allows users to plan their workouts dynamically by adding and organizing bars in a chart area, resizing the chart based on content, and saving progress for future use.

### Features
1. **Drag and Drop Functionality**:
   - Powered by the `react-beautiful-dnd` library, users can seamlessly drag workout bars from the left panel and drop them into the chart area.

2. **Dynamic Chart Updates**:
   - Each bar dropped into the chart creates an additional active bar below, representing the kilometers covered.
   - Users can extend the workout plan by adding substeps using the "Add Substep" button.

3. **Delete Bars**:
   - Users can remove any bar from the chart after it has been added, providing flexibility in modifying the workout plan.

4. **Adaptive Chart Scaling**:
   - The application automatically adjusts the size of the bars and scales the chart based on the total number of bars added, ensuring a clear and proportional display.

5. **Clear All Data**:
   - A "Clear All" button allows users to reset the entire chart by removing all bars and substeps.

6. **Save Progress**:
   - The "Save Workout" button enables users to save their current workout plan.
   - Changes made to the chart are automatically saved to local storage, ensuring no loss of data between sessions.

7. **Responsive Design**:
   - Built with **Bootstrap** and **Material-UI**, the app offers a responsive user interface, optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
